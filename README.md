llvm-cbe
========

This LLVM C backend has been resurrected by Julia Computing with various improvements.

Installation instructions
=========================

This version of the LLVM C backend works with LLVM 19, for older versions please check the [tags](https://github.com/JuliaHubOSS/llvm-cbe/tags).

Step 1: Installing LLVM
=======================

Either install the LLVM packages on your system:
--------------------------------------------

On macOS, use [pkgsrc](http://pkgsrc.joyent.com/install-on-osx/) and run the following commands:
```sh
    ~$ pkgin in llvm clang ninja-build
```

On CentOS, install the llvm-devel package:
```sh
    ~# dnf install llvm-devel clang ninja-build
```

On Debian and derivatives, install the llvm-dev package via:
```sh
    ~# apt install llvm-dev clang ninja-build
```

Note: this project uses LLVM 19, so make sure that the package manager is installing it and not some other version. At the time of writing, Ubuntu installs version 14.

Or compile LLVM yourself:
-----------------------------
Note: to convert C to LLVM IR to run the tests, you will also need a C compiler using the LLVM infrastructure, such as clang.

The first step is to compile LLVM on your machine
(this assumes an in-tree build, but out-of-tree will also work):

```sh
     ~$ git clone --single-branch --branch llvmorg-19.1.1 --depth 1 https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git
     ~$ cd llvm-project
     llvm-project$ mkdir llvm/build
     llvm-project$ cd llvm/build
     build$ cmake .. -G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DLLVM_PARALLEL_LINK_JOBS=1
     build$ ninja
```
To run tests, you need to build `lli`.


Step 2: Compiling LLVM-CBE
==========================

Now you can download and compile llvm-cbe.

If you built LLVM yourself, put it in the same folder you built LLVM in:
```sh
    ~$ cd llvm-project/llvm/projects
    projects$ git clone https://github.com/JuliaHubOSS/llvm-cbe
    projects$ cd ../build
    build$ cmake -S .. -G "Ninja"
    build$ ninja llvm-cbe
```
If you used your distribution's package, put it wherever you feel like:
```sh
    ~$ git clone https://github.com/JuliaHubOSS/llvm-cbe
    ~$ cd llvm-cbe && mkdir build && cd build
    build$ cmake -S .. -G "Ninja"
    build$ ninja llvm-cbe
```
Step 3: Usage Examples
======================

If llvm-cbe compiles, you should be able to run it with the following commands.
```sh
    llvm-cbe$ cd test/selectionsort
    selectionsort$ ls
    main.c
    selectionsort$ clang-19 -S -emit-llvm -g main.c
    selectionsort$ ls
    main.c main.ll
    selectionsort$ ../../build/tools/llvm-cbe/llvm-cbe main.ll
```

You can find options to configure the C backend's output with `llvm-cbe --help`.
Look for options beginning with `--cbe-`.

Compile Generated C Code and Run
================================

```sh
    selectionsort$ gcc -o main.cbe main.cbe.c
    selectionsort$ ls
    main.c  main.cbe  main.cbe.c  main.ll
    selectionsort$ ./main.cbe
```

Running tests
=============

Unit tests:

```sh
    llvm-project$ cd llvm/build
    build$ make CBEUnitTests && projects/llvm-cbe/unittests/CWriterTest
```

Note that you need to have passed `-DLLVM_INCLUDE_TESTS=1` to cmake if you used
your distribution's LLVM package. You also will need to install gtest (on Debian
derivatives: `apt install libgtest-dev`).

Other tests:

First, compile llvm-cbe, and install pytest (e.g. `pip install pytest`). Then:

```sh
    llvm-cbe$ pytest
```

You might have to adjust the llvm-cbe and lli paths in that configuration.

If you want the tests to run faster, installing `pytest-xdist` will allow you to run the test suite in parallel, e.g. `pytest -n 4` if you want to use 4 cores.

FAQ: Version Update Policy
==========================

The policy of this project is to only support latest released version of LLVM on the head of repo here.
The rationale is that supporting multiple versions is additional work for a project which has no sponsors.
Additionally, since there are very few changes, other than version compatibility maintenance,
anyone using an older version of LLVM can just checkout the last commit to work on that branch.
For discussion, see https://github.com/JuliaHubOSS/llvm-cbe/issues/60.
